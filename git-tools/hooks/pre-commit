# A hook to disallow php syntax errors to be committed
# by running php -l (lint) on them. It requires php-cli
# to be installed.
#
# This is a pre-commit hook.
#
# To install this you can either copy or symlink it to
# $GIT_DIR/hooks, example:
#
# ln -s ../../git-tools/hooks/pre-commit \\
#   .git/hooks/pre-commit
